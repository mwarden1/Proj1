We are creating a payroll system.
There will be instructions for the user at the beginning so he or she will be to understand how the program works.
If a user inserts an integer value when only string value is accepted an error message will occur, and vice versa.
This will allow the user to submit correct and accurate information into the payroll system.
There are different classes such as hourly rate, pay rate, commissions, number of hours worked, and employee name.
These will allow for a unique receipt for each employee within the company.
The employee will also be prompted to enter their address; including city, state, zip code and street address.
