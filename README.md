We have created a payroll system. It takes user inputs such as name, age, social security number, 
street address, zip code and gives a password to make an account. Then, once you have made the account, 
it would ask you for your week hours and payrate and then prints out your gross and net pay. 
Net pay is the pay that has add the required taxes deducted from it. After this the user will need to 
input the total of the daily sales made and from this he/she obtains the final net pay. 
This is the day that has added a percentage of the users total week sales to the previous net pay.
